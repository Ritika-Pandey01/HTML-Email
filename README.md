## Roadmap

#### Additional information for new learners
- **Use XHTML**: usually recommended
- **Use Hexcode** 
- **Use landmark** : role:"presentation" in table tags
- **Avoid divs** : Use table instead
- **Metadata to be used** : character set utf-8,compatibility meta tag for web browsers, viewport meta tag for responsiveness and you can also use color scheme meta tag for dark mode compatibility.
- **Table centering**: you can  use center tag - <center style="table-layout:fixed;">
- **Conditional Rendering** : <!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]><![endif]-->, this conditional statement covers most of the email clients.
